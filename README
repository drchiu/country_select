CountrySelect
=============

Provides a simple helper to get an HTML select list of countries.  The list of countries comes from the ISO 3166 standard.  While it is a relatively neutral source of country names, it will still offend some users.

Users are strongly advised to evaluate the suitability of this list given their user base.

*** added removal option ***

New format is:

  country_select(method, removed_countries = nil, priority_countries = nil, options = {}, html_options = {})

removed_countries is in the form of an Array

Example
=======

country_select("user", "country_name")
